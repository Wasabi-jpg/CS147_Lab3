# CS147_Lab3
This lab focuses on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and how it can be used in a Bluetooth-based step counter with a LSM6DSO accelerometer. 

## Part A: 
- Made an LED flash on/off based on whether the mobile phone sends in the string "on"/"off" respectively.

## Part B:
- Made a step counter where the string "steps" sent from the phone will send the current number of steps taken by the accelerometer.
